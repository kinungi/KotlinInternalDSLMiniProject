  Internal DSL in Kotlin for a Simple House Game
  
The idea is to create a model to simulate a kind of “house game” where objects and their contents are described.  
The intention is to use some dummy objects, infix functions, lambda with receivers, extension functions 
to help reduce DSL fluency and enhance readability.

The model consists of three objects: the house, the rooms it contains, and the people who are in those rooms. 
The result of the implementation will show some sort of hierarchy chaining] of the objects.
This DSL is aimed to show some progress on code readability and quicker ways to modify the code, 
that would not perhaps be possible if we were to use Java syntax. Here is a code snippet without DSL.
